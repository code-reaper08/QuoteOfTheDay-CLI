# QuoteOfTheDay-CLI
A simple CLI, which gives you the Quote of the Day.

##Important :
+ It is a sample CLI Which I built following [this](https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/how-to-build-command-line-applications-with-node-js) tutorial.
+ It is a sample project, and nowhere near a **Real-World CLI application.**

*Feel free to suggest me some good resources to get started with CLI development.*
